# Sub-Pixel Object tracking with Deep Learning

## Summary

**Convolutional Neural Network** is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.

**Optical flow** is the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by the relative motion between an observer and a scene.

### Nvidia Flownet

It is end to end Machine Learning Model to track Optical Flow. It Combines several datasets from SINTEL, an Optical Flow Dataset from a 3D Animated Film, to Flying Chairs which has 3D chair models superimposed on random pictures. It comes in many different versions with different speeds and capabilities.

This project used **FlownetC** model for real time Sub-Pixel object tracking.
